# Design Patterns

A collection of popular design patterns written in TypeScript

**[Null Object Pattern](https://github.com/alexandrujeman/design-patterns/tree/master/null-object-pattern):** This pattern is all about handling the null keyword in a way that removes need of if(object === null) checks from your code. It also makes handling default values for null objects easier.

**[Singleton Design Pattern](https://github.com/alexandrujeman/design-patterns/tree/master/singleton-pattern):** Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

**[Module & Revealing Module Pattern](https://github.com/alexandrujeman/design-patterns/tree/master/module-reveal-module):** Javascript does not have the typical 'private' and 'public' specifiers. However, you can achieve the same effect through application of Javascript's function-level scoping. 
The central principle of the Revealing Module pattern is that all functionality and variables should be hidden unless deliberately exposed.
