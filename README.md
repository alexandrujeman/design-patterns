A collection of popular design patterns written in TypeScript

**[Null Object Pattern](https://github.com/alexandrujeman/design-patterns/tree/master/null-object-pattern):** This pattern is all about handling the null keyword in a way that removes need of if(object == null) checks from your code. It also makes handling default values for null objects easier.
