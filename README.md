# Design Patterns

A collection of popular design patterns written in TypeScript

**[Null Object Pattern](https://github.com/alexandrujeman/design-patterns/tree/master/null-object-pattern):** This pattern is all about handling the null keyword in a way that removes need of if(object === null) checks from your code. It also makes handling default values for null objects easier.

**[Singleton Design Pattern](https://github.com/alexandrujeman/design-patterns/tree/master/singleton-pattern):** Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
