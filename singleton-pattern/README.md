# Singleton Design Pattern

**[Singleton Design Pattern](https://github.com/alexandrujeman/design-patterns/tree/master/singleton-pattern):** Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

**Demo app**

Simple logger application that uses same state across different files and instance is still preserved counting how many times logs were counted.

Run with **Node.js** for demo
\$ node index.js
